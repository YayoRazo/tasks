# Staged Commit Workflow Execution

**Task:** Execute the staged-commit workflow defined in `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/tasks/git/summarize-and-stage-files.md` for the `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/tasks` repository.

**Context:**

- The aggregated tasks workspace lives at `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/tasks`.
- All intended changes in that repository are already staged (`git add .` has been run).
- The reference task file explains how to summarize staged files, craft a commit message, commit, and push.

**What to do:**

1. Navigate to `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/tasks`.
2. Follow each step from `summarize-and-stage-files.md`, reviewing only the files that are already staged.
3. Produce the required summary, commit message, and push results exactly as described in that task.

**Deliverables:** Report back with the staged-file summary, the precise `git commit -m "..."` command executed, and the `git push` command along with its outcome.
