# Execute Staged-Commit Workflow for razo-nova-vscode

**Task:** Execute the staged-commit workflow defined in `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/tasks/git/summarize-and-stage-files.md` for the `razo-nova-vscode` repository.

**Context:**

- All desired changes are already staged (`git add .` has been run).
- The task file describes how to summarize staged files, craft a commit message, commit, and push.

**What to do:**

1. Switch to `/Users/jorgerazo/projects/razo-nova-vscode`.
2. Follow the process from `summarize-and-stage-files.md`, reviewing only the files that are currently staged.
3. Produce the required summary, commit message, and push results as outlined in that task.

**Deliverables:** The summary of staged files, the exact `git commit -m "..."` command used, and the `git push` command/result, reported back in the final response.
